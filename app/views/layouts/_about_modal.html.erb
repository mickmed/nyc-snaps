        <p>All of the photos are held, taken with a pocket point and shoot camera by Mick Medium (Michael Roth). There are no modifications to them other than the logo. Some of the views are no longer available due to construction or deconstruction. Many are taken off suspension bridges while squeezing the lens between the holes in the fence, as the wind howls off the river in winter, and as the train goes past and shakes the bridge, making for a fun but often frustrating adventure. Mick has an affinity for tug boats and art deco buildings but other unusual cityscapes are often shot. No camera phones have been used. Please enjoy.</p>
